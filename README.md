## Information about

* Medium corresponding article: [Medium link]() *not yet published*

This is the code for the tutorial on how to build and to deploy a web app with [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/). Contained here is both the code used for pre-processing the data, the pretrained model (trained with [TensorFlow](https://pytorch.org/) ),  building the app, and to deploy on the cloud. 

The app uses an artificial intelligence model to paint the style of an image on another. The user can upload an image (the content), upload a second image (the style) and apply the style on the content image.


The app can be found at this link, you can test yourself:

The code is an example of how to use a [pretrained model]() app for [neural style transfer]()
